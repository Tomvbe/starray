# ADR-001: Foundation Stack and Project Skeleton

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-18

## Context
The project needs a fast path to an MVP while keeping room for strict workflow governance and provider portability.

## Decision
Use a Python-first baseline with:
- Typer for CLI UX,
- TOML for local configuration,
- file-based JSON session state for persistence,
- per-session file logging for observability.

## Rationale
- Typer gives clear command ergonomics and low implementation overhead.
- TOML is simple to edit and parse with stdlib (`tomllib`).
- File-backed state/logs are transparent and easy to debug in early phases.

## Consequences
Positive:
- Rapid implementation of baseline workflow.
- Minimal infrastructure dependencies in early phases.
- Easy migration path to DB/backends later.

Negative:
- Limited concurrency/scale compared to database-backed state.
- Local files require care for locking in future multi-process usage.

## Follow-up
- Introduce provider adapters in Phase 1.
- Add orchestration state model in Phase 2.
- Revisit persistence backend after MVP stability.
